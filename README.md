# Predictive-Maintenance-
Machine learning model for Predictive Maintenance 


Using the “Predictive maintenance” dataset, which consists of 10,000 observations recorded as rows with eight features in columns, the report’s goal is
to create a classification model. The classifier must be able to predict the target variable, which has a value of ‘0’ if there is no failure and no
maintenance is thus required, and ‘1’ if, on the other hand, some sort of damage has been discovered in the machine and maintenance is required.
The dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/machine-predictive-maintenance-classification
(https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/machine-predictive-maintenance-classification).
The data is split in three parts: - Training set: 60% - Validation set: 20% - Testing set: 20%
The training and validation set will be used during the training, while the testing set will stay untouched until the model is ready for testing again real
world data.
In this report,the following three models of classification will be used and compared at the end to find the best model:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Neural Network
